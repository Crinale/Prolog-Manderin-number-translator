# Prolog-Manderin-number-translator
Manderin Number translator

This translator will only go up to 100 but when using prolog you learn that it allows you to put each permutation of the word in its place
for example 1234 would come out to 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34, 1234 and so on so its learning how to manipulate it so that it can
work the way you want it to
